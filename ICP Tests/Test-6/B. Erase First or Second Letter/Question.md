# 4. Erase First or Second Letter

**Problem:**

You are given a string  of length . Let's define two operations you can apply on the string:

1. Remove the first character of the string.
2. Remove the second character of the string.

Your task is to find the number of distinct **non-empty** strings that can be generated by applying the given operations on the initial string any number of times (possibly zero), in any order.

## Input Format

The first line contains a single integer  () — the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines:

* The first line contains  () — the length of the string.
* The second line contains the string  consisting of lowercase English letters.

The sum of  over all test cases does not exceed .

## Output Format

For each test case, output a single integer: the number of distinct non-empty strings you can generate.

## Constraints

## Example #1

**Input**

```
5
5
aaaaa
1
z
5
ababa
14
bcdaaaabcdaaaa
20
abcdefghijklmnopqrst

```

**Output**

```
5
1
9
50
210

```

**Explanation:**

* In the first case (`aaaaa`), the possible strings are: `a`, `aa`, `aaa`, `aaaa`, `aaaaa`.
* In the third case (`ababa`), one way to reach `ba` is: `ababa`  (remove 1st) `baba`  (remove 2nd) `bba`  (remove 2nd) `ba`.

## Solution

The key observation is that any string we can form will always be a **suffix** of the original string, possibly with some characters removed from the very beginning. Specifically, for every unique character at index , we can form  distinct strings by keeping that character as the new "first" character and taking all possible lengths of the remaining suffix.

We use a `Set` to keep track of characters we have already encountered as we iterate through the string to avoid overcounting.
