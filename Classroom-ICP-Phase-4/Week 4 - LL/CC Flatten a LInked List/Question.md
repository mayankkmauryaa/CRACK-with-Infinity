# Flatten a Linked List

Alice has a **strange singly-linked list**. A usual singly linked-list or a _not-strange linked list_ consist of nodes pointing to exactly one node ( except for the the tail node which points to null ). However, in case of a **strange singly-linked list**, instead of pointing towards a single linked-list node, some nodes of the linked-list are pointing towards two nodes! Each node in the strange linked-list has two pointers named :

- **next**
- **child**

The “child” pointer of a node may again point towards a strange singly linked list.

Alice wants to restructure this linked-list into a _not-strange linked list_. While doing so, she must follow the following rules.

Let **cur** be a node in restructured linked-list, then

- **cur.next** must occur after cur in the restructured linked-list.
- All the nodes ( if any ) which are part of **cur.child** linked list must occur after the node cur and before the node **cur.next** in the restructured linked list.
- Let **cur** be a node in the restructured linked-list, then **cur.child** must be “null”.

**NOTE** : Refer to sample case for a visual depiction.

## Input Format

- The first line of the input contains a single integer **T** - the number of test cases. The description of **T** test cases follows.
- The first line of each test case contains a single integer **N**.
- The following **N − 1** lines contain three space separated integers **u, v** and **type**.
  - If the value of **type** is equal to `0`, then the next pointer of node with value equal to **u** points towards the node with value equal to **v**.
  - If the value of **type** is equal to `1`, then the child pointer of node with value equal to **u** points towards the node with value equal to **v**.
- For C++ language, you need to:

Complete the function in the submit solution tab:
`bool flatten(Node\* head)`

---

## Output Format

For each test case, the function you complete should return the restructured linked-list.

---

## Constraints

- 1 ≤ T ≤ 100
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 2 \* 10⁵
- It is guaranteed that the sum of **N** over all test cases is less than or equal to 3 \* 10⁵

---

## Subtasks

- **5 points** : There is at most one node whose child pointer in NOT null. All the other nodes have their child pointers as null pointer.
- **95 points** : **ORIGINAL CONSTRAINTS**
